# Assignment 1

Instructions and resources

The objective of this assignment is to create and publish a single-page web site that contains four recipes, with navigation to each. 

Each recipe is a stand-alone content with appropriate sections and media. The recipes share the same layout. 

The main page is titled "My Favorite Recipes", followed by bookmarks navigation. The navigation items use the article's heading and allow the user to navigate to the corresponding recipe on the page. Each article is identified by a meaningful id value. (Optional, you can add a "Back to top" link at the end of each article" - note this is not part of the article).
